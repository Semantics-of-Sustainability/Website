        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Semantics of Sustainability</strong> project, funded by the NL eScience Center, utilizes cutting-edge machine learning techniques to study how Dutch words have evolved in public discourses around sustainability. By analyzing historical Dutch newspapers, magazines, and books from World War II to the present, we aim to uncover shifts in meaning and connotation, offering fresh insights into the forces shaping global sustainability conversations today.</p>
        <p>This initiative is a collaboration between the eScience Center, Utrecht University, and the National Library of The Hague, bringing together experts in machine learning, digital humanities, and archival research.</p>
